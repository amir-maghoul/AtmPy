Introduction
============

``pyddg`` is a python library for geometry, discrete differential geometry, and its visualization in `Blender <https://www.blender.org/>`_.

It provides

- **geometry**: projective geometry and subgeometries (Klein Erlangen program):
   -  Projective subspaces, quadrics, spheres
   -  Cayley-Klein geometries and different models:
      Euclidean, elliptic, spherical, hyperbolic, MÃ¶bius, ...

- **visualization**:
   -  Interface for visualization and animation in Blender

- **datastructures** for discrete surfaces:
   -  Indexed face set
   -  Half-edge
   -  Discrete nets

- **optimize**:
   -  Energy optimization on discrete surfaces
